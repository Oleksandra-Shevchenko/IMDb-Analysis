# IMDb Data Analysis
&nbsp; 
## Project Overview 

This project explores trends in the IMDb dataset to better understand what types of content are produced, how audiences rate them, and who the most active or successful contributors are. 
I focus on visualizing key metrics like genre popularity, production volume over time, average ratings, and contributor performance in a clear and approachable way.

&nbsp; 
## Key Objectives
The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the IMDb dataset by answering several key questions:

  - What types of content (e.g. movies, series, episodes) are most common?

  - How has production volume changed over time?

  - Which genres are the most popular and which receive the highest ratings?

  - What is the typical runtime for different types of content?

  - Who are the most active and highest-rated actors and directors?

  - Is there a connection between how popular a title is (number of votes) and how well it's rated?
    
&nbsp;
 ## Data Sources
The analysis is based on IMDb data files manually downloaded from the official [IMDb datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) page and then uploaded to Google BigQuery for querying. 
The following tables were created from the corresponding TSV files:


  - **IMDb_dataset.title_basics → title.basics.tsv**
    
Contains metadata about titles, including type (movie, short, TV episode), primary title, original title, start/end year, runtime, and genres.

  - **IMDb_dataset.title_ratings → title.ratings.tsv**
    
Includes the average IMDb rating and the number of votes each title has received

  - **IMDb_dataset.title_principals → title.principals.tsv**
    
Maps titles to their main cast and crew (actors, actresses, directors, etc.), including their role categories and order of appearance.

  - **IMDb_dataset.name → name.basics.tsv**
    
rovides information about individuals (e.g. actors, directors), including their birth/death years and known titles.

  - **IMDb_dataset.title_crew → title.crew.tsv**
    
 Contains directors and writers for each title, often stored as comma-separated IDs.

 &nbsp; 
## Tools & Technologies
  - **Google BigQuery** for SQL querying large datasets

  - **Python** for data analysis and visualization

  - **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scipy

&nbsp; 
## Key Insights from the Analysis
  - **TV Episodes dominate** the IMDb dataset, far outnumbering other content types due to each episode being counted individually. Short films and full-length movies also represent a significant portion of the database.

  - **Content production has surged** over the past few decades. While earlier decades saw steady output, production dramatically increased starting in the 1990s and peaked in the 2010s—likely driven by the rise of television and streaming platforms.

  - **Runtimes vary significantly** by content type. Video games and feature films have the longest average runtimes, while TV episodes and shorts are considerably shorter, consistent with their formats.

  - **Top genres like Drama, Comedy, and Documentary** dominate both film and TV, but some genres like Reality-TV and Talk-Show appear almost exclusively in series format, reflecting differences in storytelling and audience preferences.

  - **Genres with the highest ratings** (based on well-rated and widely voted content) include Biography, Animation, and Drama, which consistently receive strong viewer feedback.

  - **The most active actors and directors** have worked on hundreds (or even thousands) of titles, often in regional or serialized TV. For example, Matsunosuke Onoe and Johnny Manahan lead their respective categories by volume.

  - **Top-rated performers and directors** include well-established names with high consistency. Directors like Tomohisa Taguchi and actors in high-profile dramas stand out with excellent average ratings across multiple titles.

  - **“Famous” directors** (with a high volume of popular work) tend to have better average ratings than “regular” ones, suggesting that reputation and reach may correlate with quality or perception.

  - **The most highly rated movies** with large vote counts include widely recognized titles like The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, and The Dark Knight, indicating enduring popularity and critical acclaim.

  - **There’s a moderate positive correlation** between the number of votes and the average rating of a title. Highly rated titles tend to attract more viewers, or vice versa, but there’s still wide variance.

  - **Average genre ratings have increased over time,** particularly for Documentary and Drama, showing a trend toward higher audience satisfaction in recent decades.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Title Type Distribution
---
![imdb analysis](plots/general_count.png)
This chart illustrates the breakdown of content types in the IMDb dataset. **TV episodes** dominate by a significant margin, accounting for the majority of entries. This is primarily because each episode of a TV series is listed as an individual record. Following that, **short films and movies** are the next most common types, reflecting their popularity and consistent production across decades.

&nbsp;
### Production Over Time
---
![imdb analysis](plots/titles_by_decade.png)
This line chart highlights the growth in content production over time. From 1900 to 1980, the number of titles remained relatively modest. A sharp rise began in the 1990s, accelerating into the 2010s where production peaked at over **4 million titles**, fueled by the expansion of TV content and streaming platforms. The decline in the 2020s is likely due to **incomplete data** for the ongoing decade.

&nbsp;
### Average Runtime by Title Type

&nbsp;
### Correlation Between IMDb Rating and Number of Votes
---
![imdb analysis](plots/correlation_ratings_votes.png)
This scatter plot visualizes how **average IMDb rating** relates to the **number of votes** for titles with over **1 million votes**.

  - Each point represents a movie, with the x-axis showing vote counts (log-scaled for clarity) and the y-axis showing the IMDb rating.

  - A **positive correlation** is visible, confirmed by a linear trend line (r ≈ **0.63**), indicating that **more popular movies tend to have slightly higher ratings**.

  - While the trend is upward, the spread suggests that high vote counts don’t guarantee high ratings — but many highly rated titles tend to gather large audiences over time.

This analysis highlights how **audience size and engagement** often reflect or amplify a movie’s reputation, but it also reinforces that quality and popularity are not always equivalent.


&nbsp;
