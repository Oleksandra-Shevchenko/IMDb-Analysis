&nbsp; 
## üöÄ Introduction: What Makes a Film Popular?
In the world of cinema, where hundreds of new films are released every day, understanding what truly captures the audience‚Äôs attention is a challenging yet fascinating task. In this personal project, I explore publicly available IMDb datasets to uncover the key factors that influence viewer recognition and film popularity. My goal is to understand how genres, runtime, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîthe involvement of specific directors and actors shape how audiences perceive a film. I also look at how these preferences have evolved over time.

This project does not aim to predict box office revenue or commercial success, as it relies solely on publicly accessible IMDb data that does not include financial information. Instead, the focus is on analyzing critical and audience reception‚Äîaverage ratings and vote counts‚Äîand on examining the impact of the people behind and in front of the camera.

&nbsp; 
## ‚ùì Key Research Questions
In this project, I aim to answer the following questions using IMDb data:

- What defines a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù film in terms of audience ratings and overall popularity?

- How are genres and keywords related to a film‚Äôs ratings and popularity?

- How have ratings, popularity, and genre preferences in the film industry evolved over time?

- Which directors and actors (based on their specific roles) are consistently associated with highly rated and popular films?

- How does a film‚Äôs runtime affect its average rating and number of votes?


&nbsp;
 ## Data Sources
The analysis is based on IMDb data files manually downloaded from the official [IMDb datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) page and then uploaded to Google BigQuery for querying. 
The following tables were created from the corresponding TSV files:


  - **IMDb_dataset.title_basics ‚Üí title.basics.tsv**
    
Contains metadata about titles, including type (movie, short, TV episode), primary title, original title, start/end year, runtime, and genres.

  - **IMDb_dataset.title_ratings ‚Üí title.ratings.tsv**
    
Includes the average IMDb rating and the number of votes each title has received

  - **IMDb_dataset.title_principals ‚Üí title.principals.tsv**
    
Maps titles to their main cast and crew (actors, actresses, directors, etc.), including their role categories and order of appearance.

  - **IMDb_dataset.name ‚Üí name.basics.tsv**
    
rovides information about individuals (e.g. actors, directors), including their birth/death years and known titles.

  - **IMDb_dataset.title_crew ‚Üí title.crew.tsv**
    
 Contains directors and writers for each title, often stored as comma-separated IDs.

üßπ Data Preparation: Making the Data Clean and Analysis-Ready

High-quality analysis starts with clean data. Before diving into the exploration, I completed the following data preparation steps (the full code and process details are available in [cleaning_scripts](./cleaning_scripts)):

- Data merging: The original TSV files were converted to CSV and merged using the common movie identifier (tconst) to form a unified dataset for analysis (specifically, title_ratings and title_basics tables).

- Handling missing values: Missing data in key columns (averageRating, numVotes, genres, runtimeMinutes, startYear) was addressed‚Äîprimarily by removing incomplete rows or imputing values logically‚Äîto ensure accurate calculations.

- Data type conversion: Columns such as startYear, runtimeMinutes, averageRating, and numVotes were cast to appropriate numeric formats.

- Parsing categorical data: Genre values, as well as director and actor identifiers (stored as comma-separated strings), were parsed‚Äîoften within SQL queries‚Äîfor entity-level analysis.


 &nbsp; 
## Tools & Technologies
  - **Google BigQuery** for SQL querying large datasets

  - **Python** for data analysis and visualization

  - **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scipy

&nbsp; 
## Key Insights from the Analysis
  - **TV Episodes dominate** the IMDb dataset, far outnumbering other content types due to each episode being counted individually. Short films and full-length movies also represent a significant portion of the database.

  - **Content production has surged** over the past few decades. While earlier decades saw steady output, production dramatically increased starting in the 1990s and peaked in the 2010s‚Äîlikely driven by the rise of television and streaming platforms.

  - **Runtimes vary significantly** by content type. Video games and feature films have the longest average runtimes, while TV episodes and shorts are considerably shorter, consistent with their formats.

  - **Top genres like Drama, Comedy, and Documentary** dominate both film and TV, but some genres like Reality-TV and Talk-Show appear almost exclusively in series format, reflecting differences in storytelling and audience preferences.

  - **Genres with the highest ratings** (based on well-rated and widely voted content) include Biography, Animation, and Drama, which consistently receive strong viewer feedback.

  - **The most active actors and directors** have worked on hundreds (or even thousands) of titles, often in regional or serialized TV. For example, Matsunosuke Onoe and Johnny Manahan lead their respective categories by volume.

  - **Top-rated performers and directors** include well-established names with high consistency. Directors like Tomohisa Taguchi and actors in high-profile dramas stand out with excellent average ratings across multiple titles.

  - **‚ÄúFamous‚Äù directors** (with a high volume of popular work) tend to have better average ratings than ‚Äúregular‚Äù ones, suggesting that reputation and reach may correlate with quality or perception.

  - **The most highly rated movies** with large vote counts include widely recognized titles like The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, and The Dark Knight, indicating enduring popularity and critical acclaim.

  - **There‚Äôs a moderate positive correlation** between the number of votes and the average rating of a title. Highly rated titles tend to attract more viewers, or vice versa, but there‚Äôs still wide variance.

  - **Average genre ratings have increased over time,** particularly for Documentary and Drama, showing a trend toward higher audience satisfaction in recent decades.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Title Type Distribution
---
![imdb analysis](plots/general_count.png)
This chart illustrates the breakdown of content types in the IMDb dataset. **TV episodes** dominate by a significant margin, accounting for the majority of entries.
