# IMDb Data Analysis
&nbsp; 
## Project Overview 

This project explores trends in the IMDb dataset to better understand what types of content are produced, how audiences rate them, and who the most active or successful contributors are. 
I focus on visualizing key metrics like genre popularity, production volume over time, average ratings, and contributor performance in a clear and approachable way.

&nbsp; 
## Key Objectives
The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the IMDb dataset by answering several key questions:

  - What types of content (e.g. movies, series, episodes) are most common?

  - How has production volume changed over time?

  - Which genres are the most popular and which receive the highest ratings?

  - What is the typical runtime for different types of content?

  - Who are the most active and highest-rated actors and directors?

  - Is there a connection between how popular a title is (number of votes) and how well it's rated?

 ## Data Sources

The following tables were created from the corresponding TSV files:
